This directory contains tools for developing and maintaining `bbre`.

|File|Description|
|----|-----------|
|`Makefile`|contains targets that aid development (run `make help_targets` for info)|
|`README.md`|this file|
|`bench.c`|benchmarking utility, runs various predefined benchmarks on the code|
|`debug_utils.c`|utility functions callable from a debugger that visualize internal data structures|
|`fuzz_db.json`|database of test cases found through fuzzing|
|`fuzzington/`|a regex fuzzer written in Rust that is used to fuzz `bbre`.|
|`mptest.c`, `mptest.h`|testing framework, written by yours truly|
|`parser_fuzz.c`|LLVM fuzzer driver for `bbre`'s parser and compiler|
|`port/`|skeleton for building a minimal distribution of `bbre` and its tests that can be used for porting to different platforms without, for example, Python or a `gcc`-compatible C compiler.|
|`scripts/`|Python scripts used for generating code, tests, and documentation.|
|`test.c`|main functionality/coverage tests|
|`test_config.h`|test harness configuration (malloc hook, etc.)|
